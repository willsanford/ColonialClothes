No object file was viewed, but the catalog card was. See the image of the card with the stomacher this apron may correspond to (Accession number 1979.43). It is unclear if the apron's description means that this apron was remade from an embroidered dress or not. However, aprons with similar designs, motifs, and embroidery to this appear throughout American and English costume collections and the grand majority were made as their own garment, rather than from a piece of a gown. Based on the dating of those extant aprons in other collections also, this apron likely was worn and made before the 1780s. Its exact American origin is known, but the ambiguity of this object, connection to the Gilman Garrison House (Exeter, N.H.), its donation by an American family to Historic New England is the reasoning behind its inclusion.",

Blackburn's invoice to Sayward survives and indicates that his fee for the portrait was ten guineas, approximately the cost of a very expensive piece of case furniture...Sally was the Saywards' only child. At the time of her portrait, the twenty-three-year-old and her two-year-old daughter were living with her parents while her husband, merchant Nathaniel Barrell, was in the midst of a three-year business trip to England. The painting shows a typically idealized image of eighteenth-century womanhood, with Mrs. Barrell loosely holding a basket of roses over one arm and a rose bud in the other hand. A few years after this portrait was painted, Sally's husband Nathaniel Barrell broke with his father-in-law over religious differences and refused to allow his children to see their grandfather. The rift lasted for seventeen years, during which time this portrait, hanging in the Sayward's parlor, must have served as a poignant reminder of family troubles...In 1761 Sally Sayward Barrell was living in her parents\u0092 home in what is now York, Maine, while her husband was on a three-year business trip to England.\" ",

[2]Dorothy\u2019s silk pink robe and matching stomacher are decorated with a large bow, and the sleeves end in triple ruffles, probably of white worked muslin rather than lace. Her sheer apron is also of muslin, embroidered with large floral sprays. Although aprons are now associated with working life, in the eighteenth century they were appropriate for all but the most formal occasions as long as they were of expensive fabric. [3]The frothy dress cap, brilliant pink dress, and delicate muslin ruffles and apron reflected the wealth of the Quincy family and were suitable adornment for this eligible young woman, known to friends and family as \u201cDolly.\"",

        "notes": "\"When Copley painted Mercy Otis Warren (1728\u20131814), at the age of about thirty-six or thirty-seven, she was a Plymouth, Massachusetts, housewife and mother of three sons (two more were to be born between 1764 and 1766); she would later make her name as one of the first chroniclers of the American Revolution and a dedicated campaigner for the patriot cause....Mercy Warren\u2019s dress appears in two other portraits by Copley: Mrs. Benjamin Pickman (Mary Toppan) (1763, Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut) and Mrs. Daniel Sargent (Mary Turner) (1763, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco). Mrs. Pickman and Mrs. Sargent were much younger than Mercy Warren, and were painted at the time of their marriages. Art historian Margaretta Lovell has suggested that the expensive blue dress belonged to the Warrens and that they loaned the dress to Mrs. Pickman and Mrs. Sargent for the purpose of wearing it for their portraits, augmenting it with different trimmings but emphasizing family friendships and alliances. The gown is cut low, and in the portraits of both young sitters, the pale skin of their chests is exposed in advertisement of their beauty. Mercy Warren\u2019s costume, however, has been augmented with a lace stole, a modest touch appropriate to her age and status as matron. She looks directly at the viewer; the levelness of her gaze and the determined set of her mouth suggest (at least to the present-day observer with the luxury of hindsight) the side of her character that will within a decade venture forth from the realm of such acceptable feminine pursuits as gardening and child rearing into the masculine sphere of dramaturgy, political satire, and historical analysis.\" See Margaretta M. Lovell, \u201cMrs. Sargent, Mr. Copley, and the Empirical Eye,\u201d Winterthur Portfolio 33, no. 1 (Spring 1998): 34.",

The first of these was executed by Robert Feke [42.424] shortly after Winslow\u2019s marriage, in December 1747, to Lucy Waldo of Boston. In about 1756, a large inheritance enabled them to settle in Roxbury, where they acquired the Dudley Mansion. They documented their position as the most prominent family in Roxbury with another portrait, this one by Blackburn [42.684]. Lucy Winslow died in 1768. Two years later Isaac married Jemima Debuke (1732\u20131790), daughter of Thomas and Jemima Reed Debuke of Boston; Winslow was twenty-three years her senior. In 1773, in keeping with his custom of documenting with portraits each significant change in family status, Winslow hired Copley to depict him and his new wife in an intimate double portrait.\"",

Serving as Governor until 1708, Lord Cornbury was reported to have been \"universally detested,\" and a fondness for cross-dressing accompanied his reputation as \"half-witted.\" Popular legend had it that the Governor discredited his office by publicly appearing in women's attire, strolling Broadway - even opening the Assembly - in his wife's clothes. Hyde is also said to have held his state levees at New York, and received his visitors dressed up in complete female court costume, because he represented the person of a female Sovereign, his cousin Queen Anne. Recent scholarship has both removed some of the blemishes added to Cornbury's gubernatorial abilities by nineteenth century detractors, and reclaimed the likeness as female. However the sitter's identity, like that of the artist who captured her straightforward gaze without softening her features for the sake of a beautiful picture, remains a mystery.\"\n",

She wears a white cap with two layers of fabric surrounding her face. The cap is tied in a bow with a narrow white ribbon at her neck. Mrs. Waldo has hazel eyes and a face that is nearly round, with creases to the sides of her nose and mouth. The modeling is stark, and the edges are hard. Her flesh droops along her jawline, and her throat swells between two creases...In this imposing image of Faith Savage Waldo, Joseph Badger reveals several clues about his sitter\u2019s biography. Mrs. Waldo\u2019s vividly patterned dress is a flowered damask, an expensive fabric\u2014and probably relates to her successful business as a textile importer. According to a Boston advertisement, she offered \u201cSattins, Lute-strings, Mantua Silks, black Padosoy, Alamode, Damask Table Linen, Chints, Calicoes, fine Cambricks, Muslins, Hollands, Garlicks and sundry other choice Goods, lately Imported from London, by Wholesale and Retail at very Reasonable Rates.\u201d The book she holds in her lap also indicates that she is able to read and write: not a given for women in Colonial times and a necessary skill for a merchant. In addition to this portrait, Badger also painted her husband.\" A gown belonging to Waldo is in this database (AA_2021lot229_v1).",

Badger worked in a modest style, characterized by a simple palette of blues and browns and a sparing use of paint. This portrait of Hannah Haskins was most likely commissioned as a pendant pair with that of her husband, John Haskins, at the left. Mrs. Haskins followed the Congregationalist faith while her husband was a devout Episcopalian, and on Sundays they led separate contingents of their children to their respective churches. Though the staid appearance of the portraits may be a result of Badger\u2019s limited training, the style suits the pious couple.\"",

The front bodice panels are smooth, and the back is fitted with three seams. (Originally, the front of the bodice was dipped, but it was turned up so the waistline would be straight later in the eighteenth century. Also, the center back of the bodice originally continued down the length of the skirt in the \"en ferreau\" style, but it was altered to a point.) There are no side seams. The skirt is knife-pleated with half-inch pleats and stitched to the lower edge of the bodice. (Originally, the skirt was probably made to be open in front to show a decorative petticoat. Other alterations include the center front opening of the bodice, which was originally turned under about half an inch on each side, and the ruffle around the neckline, which was originally pleated and thus much fuller. Also, the hem had been turned up, but this was taken out at the time of cataloguing.)\"",

The bodice opens at center front and would have fastened with pins. The front panel of the skirt is open along the side seams for about ten inches; the top edge is gathered on a drawstring to tie around the waist under the bodice back. The back of the skirt is knife-pleated to the bodice. The bodice is lined with blue and cream-colored woven check linen. The lining is patched with blue and white linen gingham at the proper left inside edge. Both edges of the bodice opening have been pieced out with strips of the dress fabric to make the bodice wider, perhaps when the original wearer gained weight.\"",

The website notes Natalie Rothstein's seminal book, Silk Designs of the Eighteenth Century. This database believes that it may have been referencing pages 208-211 and 243-245 that show very similar looking textiles designed by Anna Maria Garthwaite from around 1747-1752. This textile may very well also be designed b Garthwaite of Spitalfields, London and have been imported to America. Its exact American origin is also known, but the ambiguity of this object and its donation by an American family to Historic New England is the reasoning behind its inclusion. The gown was altered around 1890. The gown comes with additional three panel pieces and two scalloped edged fragments, likely all removed during the alteration. This database also hypothesizes that the two scalloped pieces were from the sleeve ruffles. It is unclear if these were removed at 1890 or earlier when ruffles fell out of fashion during the late 1780s-1790s. ",

The pleated length of fabric that fell from the back neckline to the floor was removed and the neckline and sleeves were altered, among other changes. The designer of the brocade pattern was most likely the renowned Anna Marie Garthwaite who worked in Spitalfields, where London\u2019s choicest silks were woven. The quality of Spitalfields silk is evident in the survival of this magnificent fabric and its natural deep green dye, unfaded for over 270 years.\" Byles wore these shoes with a matching shoes also featured in this database (MHS_Shoes005).

Its discovery in an American estate is intriguing because of its conspicuous use of yards of French silk at a time when such goods were contraband...The complexity of the weave structure does not necessarily hint at Lyon as a locus of manufacture as Huguenot weavers in London\u2019s Spitalfields district were capable of equally elaborate feats, but the style of the flowers and pattern, with undulating streamers layered with sprays, is distinctly French and specific to the 1760s. By contrast, a pronounced formality, characterized by an orderly and controlled layout, is not common in English examples, which convey a greater sense of spontaneity. Double-layered sleeve ruffles, serpentine bands of self-fabric ruching down the bodice and skirt edges, and coordinating fly fringe trim further support a dating of this dress to the mid-1760s or early 1770s...Provenance: By descent in the Hamilton family, Southbury, Connecticut.\" See the catalog for more information: https://issuu.com/coraginsburg/docs/coraginsburg2017?fr=sOGMyNTE1NzQwNzU",

Anne Beach was born on 25 April 1729 the daughter of Sarah (died 1763) and William Beach. She married William Samuel Johnson (7 October 1727-14 November 1819) on 5 November 1749. He was the son of Reverend Dr. Samuel Johnson (1696-1772), the Anglican minister in Stratford, Connecticut and Charity Floyd Nicoll (died 1758)",

(Family history recorded that it was sent from England by a relative of the Ballantines who wore it at court as a lady-in-waiting. This part of the story is unverifiable.) The silk dates to about 1720-25 and was probably first made into a dress at that time. It quite likely was remade between that time and the late 1760s. It was common for expensive silks like this to be remade multiple times over the course of decades. However, the 1769 version may have been its last in the 18th century, as the sack-back style was going out of favor by 1770. A later remodeling probably would have involved converting it to a fitted (robe \u00e0 l'anglaise) back. It was, however, worn to numerous Colonial commemorative events between at least 1876 and 1932...The silk design falls into two categories of early 18th century silk design: the stylized lace designs are seen in \"lace pattern\" silks, so named because their resemblance to actual lace patterns. The inclusion of unrelated objects of varying scale is characteristic of \"bizarre\" silks, seen here in the widely varying scale of the flora juxtaposed next to the lengths of \"lace.\"\" The skirt has a separate catalog number (3333.B).",

The use of shading adds a three-dimensional quality to the floral design, achieving a more naturalistic effect. The fabric is likely English, though the narrow width of the fabric (at about 15 \u00be\u201d wide) suggests a possible Dutch origin.

The dress has been altered multiple times, first for several fashionable updates and later for Colonial Revival events. It currently mostly reflects its late 1790s iteration. Although the donor's given date of 1762 is possible for the fabric, the dress has been altered several times: at least once in the 1770s or 1780s, once in the early 1790s, and again in the mid- to late-1790s. Two of Sarah Fulton's daughters were married in the 1790s, one in 1796 and one in 1799. Both of them may have worn the dress for their weddings. The dress was also altered for Colonial/Revolutionary commemorative events in the late 19th or early 20th century. Originally, the front edges of the bodice would not have met at the center front, but would have been worn with a stomacher. The fabric used for the front robings (pleats either side of the front opening, extending from shoulder to waistline) would have been removed after ca. 1770 when the stomacher was no longer commonly worn. This fabric was probably used to extend the bodice front, so that the edges of the bodice would meet at center front (the new style in the 1770s).\" See the DAR link for notes on the even later alterations.",

In the 1770s when the stomacher style was replaced by bodices which met at center front, this dress was reconfigured by removing the robing pleats and adding strips of silk at center front. Great care was taken to make the design of the silk match at center front. The lining extends without a seam all the way to center front and thus dates to this later construction. At some point, an extra panel of the silk was basted into the open front of the dress to create the illusion of a matching petticoat...Family history relates that this dress was worn by Elizabeth Park of Concord, Massachusetts at her marriage to Nicholas Baylies in 1738.

According to family tradition, this gown was worn by Hannah Hopkins (1731-1766) of Springfield, Massachusetts, for her marriage to John Worthington (1719-1800), a lawyer from Springfield, in 1759; by their daughter, Hannah Worthington (1761-1833) who married Thomas Dwight (1758-1819) of Springfield in 1791; by their daughter, Elizabeth (\"Betsey\") Dwight (1801-1855) who married Charles Howard (1794-1875) in 1824. Woven on a drawloom, it is made from a patterned silk known as a brocade. Supplementary weft (or horizontal) patterning threads of silk form the color and primary design interest. This kind of textile was one of the most expensive available, and its ownership in the Connecticut River Valley during the 18th century is remarkable. The silk\u2019s pattern first had to be drawn out by a designer, possibly John Vansommer (1706-1774), and then translated into the set-up of the drawloom for weaving. The whole process could take several months, and new designs were issued seasonally. The Hopkins family acquired this material as a special order, either from a merchant in Boston or New York, or else from abroad. Because of the recognized importance of the textile, the garment was remade several times during its life for the subsequent family weddings, as seen on the bodice front, where still-visible fold lines indicate alterations (an earlier a l'anglaise pleating now on either side of the center front bodice closure, which could also be earlier front robings pressed flat), which was sometimes referred to in the period as \u201cturning\u201d a garment. The most recent alteration reflects a date of about the 1780s or early 1790s. The robe opens in front with a center closure and low, rounded neckline. The bodice ends in a 'V' shaped seam in the front and back. The three quarter length sleeves, shaped to fit the natural bend in the arm, each end in a lace ruffle, applied later. The robe skirt is pleated at sides and back, where it is stitched into the waist seam. The bodice is lined in an off-white linen; the skirt is unlined. There are also horizontal lines near the top of the skirt, which may be where skirt was originally folded over.\"",

It may have belonged to Abigail Carteret Whittemore (1737-1807), who wore it to her wedding to William Whittemore in 1757; however, the file also states that it may have actually belonged to one of the wives of an English soldier stationed in Cambridge around 1757.

The textile has been dated as from 1725-1730, but the cut matches the style of the 1770s more so. Thus, the exact date of its construction is unclear. According to an accompanying letter, the gown was actually procured by her brother and sent to her \"made as it is\" (i.e., constructed in England based on measurements provided) from London, England for the occasion of her 1770 wedding. This gown also has a seemingly corresponding Chinese silk petticoat that two separate individuals in the object record identified as possibly from the 1770 wedding, but certainly later than the 1725-1730 dating on the textile.",

Style similar to robe a la francaise with center back pleats. Bodice lined with linen and cream silk. Skirt unlined, narrow tape ties at waist.\" These images of this gown were provided by Livy Scott (database author) from a research visit to Historic New England's headquarters. No object file was examined for this gown (Accession number 1926.906 A), but the object file for the underskirt photographed (Accession number 1923.554) was examined. Its exact American origin is also known, but the ambiguity of this object and its donation by to Historic New England is the reasoning behind its inclusion. This gown has been altered in the nineteenth century. There are two potentialcandidatess for the corresponding underskirt for this gown. The underskirt photographed (Accession number 1923.554) on the left of the matches at first glance, but a closer investigation of the skirt in person allowed this author (Livy Scott) to see that the patterns did not acutally correspondexactlyy and were made of slightly different fabrics. The stiching is also notconsistentt. A textile analysis of the fibre may producee moredefinitivee results. Another underskirt (Accession number 1926.907) may be a better contender according to the website. It was not analyzed by this author so no pictures are included. Historic New England describes it as \"Rectangular, off white silk brocade fragment seamed from two pieces; overall pattern of repeating pomegranates and floral bunches. Hemmed edges. May be the underskirt for dress 1926.906.\" The dating of this underskirt at around 1750 makes more sense for this garment and has been adopted by this database. Floral damask patterns like those seen in bothunderskirtss and this gown were popular from the 1720s to 1750s. See https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/31154 ",

They settled in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, where they are buried. If Deborah took this dress with her to Nova Scotia, it quite likely returned to Plymouth via her daughter, Joanna White Davis (1788-1871), who was born in Nova Scotia but married into the Davis family of Plymouth and is buried here. Her granddaughter, Joanna White Davis Morgan (1855-1931) was the donor of the dress to our collection (recorded as Mrs. R. H.

This silk gown is believed to have been worn by Mary Livingston Duane to the inaugural ball held in New York City. Her husband, James Duane, was the mayor of New York...The back of the bodice is cut and pleated to the body, which is referred to as the \u201crobe a l\u2019Anglaise\u201d style. The trained skirt section is attached to the bodice from the side fronts across to the back, being pleated at the back...There are slits in the side seams of the skirt section for pulling the fabric up and through to create an alternate style called \u201cPolanoise\u201d. The matching petticoat is pleated onto a narrow tape with side openings...Although the current style of this dress dates from 1789, the fabric dates between 1765 and 1766.\" Misdating of gowns worn to events honoring George Washington is common and those stories often override all other provenance. This gown was included in this database because of its earlier textile and highly possible earlier construction. ",

        "notes": "\"Deborah Sampson Gannett (1760-1827) led a life that, with one extraordinary exception, was typical of impoverished women of her time. Born to farmers in Plympton, Massachusetts, she worked as an indentured servant from the age of ten until she enlisted in the Continental Army as a man, first giving her name as Timothy Thayer then as Robert Shurtleff, in 1782. Wounded in Tarrytown, New York, Deborah avoided discovery for eighteen months, when she contracted yellow fever and received an honorable discharge in 1783. By 1792 she had successfully been granted her back pay for service in the Massachusetts Fourth Regiment...This dress, a style known as a \"round gown\" for the closed skirt in front, is an updated 1780s version of an earlier gown. The dress remained in the family until 1998. Family history identifies it as Deborah's wedding dress.\" Deborah Sampson Gannet was born in 1760, which makes her wearing this dress at age 10 unlikely; however, she may have owned the textile at this point possibly. She was married in 1785. ",

The Concord Museum attributed it to 1710-1728 because of similar \"silk, like Joseph Harley christening blanket, c. 1710 (Natalie Rothstein at V&A)\" and information given by the donor: \"The brocade gown enclosed herewith was the apparel of Mary Noyes Buckley wife of Richard Buckley (sometimes Buckley of Buckley). They were married Sept. 12, 1728. Hence to her daughter Abigail, who bequeathed it to her niece Mary, granddaughter of Richard and Mary, daughter of John and Sarah Buckley. Mary become the wife of Richard Brooke Hewes 1799.\" Dress appears to have been altered at some point and then was restored \"to what was considered to be a gown in about 1770-75\" in 1975.  There are various factors that make this database inclined to say it is later than 1728 - the sleeve ruffles and engageantes were a later trend, more around the 1760s and 1770s; the robe a la Francaise sacque-back, which is a dead giveaway that it must be more like 1770s; and the silk speaks to more of the middle of the period preoccupation with light botanical prints from Spitalfields. The open bodice and stomacher are characteristic of more 1740s,1750s, 1760s, but with a robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, they were more common. The cut of the gown is better dated to somewhere in the 1760s-1770s. It is possible original wearer may have been misidentified and that it was actually a later woman in the family from around that date. A more exact analysis of this textile's date of origin could produce fruitful results in the dating. A pair of shoes is also attributed to the dress and said to have been worn at the same time by the same person (which may also be a inaccurate), but these shoes also speaks to the later dating as the silks is 1760s and the construction of the shoe relates more to the typical styles of the 1760s-1770s.

        "notes": "\"Originally constructed as a formal robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, this brocaded silk satin gown was modified around 1780 to update it into a robe \u00e0 l'anglaise (also called a \u201cnightgown\u201d in England), part of a shift to more informal styles of the last quarter of the century. While the robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise with its loose flowing pleats extending from the upper back to the hem was worn over wide panniers, the bodice of the robe \u00e0 l'anglaise fitted tightly into the small of the back ending in a deep point and the closely pleated skirts were supported by crescent-shaped pads with cork or horsehair, familiarly referred to as \u201cbum rolls.\u201d Other changes made to the dress include a center-front edge-to-edge closing, rather than a stomacher to fill in the opening, and sleeves that cup the elbow and likely would have been accessorized with fine cotton or gauze cuffs, rather than the multiple pendant self-ruffles and lace engagements typical of the robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise. Additionally, at the time of its alteration, linen loops were stitched to the inside seams of the skirt in order that it could be drawn up into the exuberant swags of the robe \u00e0 la polonaise, another fashionable style of the 1770s and 1780s....The dress is believed to have been belonged to Catherine Beekman (1762\u20131839), wife of Elisha Boudinot (1749\u20131819), a lawyer and a New Jersey Supreme Court Justice from 1798 to 1804. Married in 1805, Beekman was Boudinot\u2019s third wife. A portrait of Catharine Beekman at age five by John Durand is in the collection of the New-York Historical Society (1962.73). An embroidered muslin dress with matching fichu, ca. 1798, also believed to have belonged to Catharine Beekman, is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1992.119.1a-c).\" For more on how a robe \u00e0 l'anglaise can be worn \u00e1 la polonaise, see Kendra Van Cleave and Brooke Welborn, \u201c\u201cVery Much the Taste and Various Are the Makes:\" Reconsidering the Late-Eighteenth Century Robe \u00e0 La Polonaise,\u201d Dress 39, no. 1 (May 1, 2013): 1\u201324, https://doi.org/10.1179/0361211213Z.0000000008.",

This petticoat was donated by William Perry Dudley, descendants of the Gilman family. This petticoat border was likely collected during a period of reinvest into the family's colonial history and maybe bought as a part of that personal initiative. The linen of this skirt corresponds to the 1875 to 1900 dating and the border was likely attached around that date. Many petticoat borders still exist in museum collections that are not connected to a petticoat or underskirt currently. This may have been an instance of one of those types of extant embroidered borders being recreated into a new garment in the late nineteenth century. ",

The seaming on the on edge in the photograph appears to indicate that the straps of earlier shoes of this century were removed. It is likely these shoes were owned by someone before Mary Aspinwall, likely one of her ancestors.",

The essence of English Rococo was typically distilled into naturalistic rendering of botanical detail with flowers casually scattered across an open ground, often ivory in color, in asymmetrical arrangements suggesting fresh gatherings from field or garden. This particular weave- called tobine during the period--is characterized by ribs that create an appearance of small monochrome checks and often featured self-colored patterning and brocaded floral motifs, such as seen here...The American provenance of these shoes connects them to Fanny Bemis (1771-1852), daughter of Sarah Bemis (n\u00e9e White, born in Framingham, Massachusetts in 1737 and died in Spencer, Massachusetts, 1791). They may have been the shoes worn on the occasion of Sarah White's marriage to Joshua Bemis (1729-1789) on September 18th, 1755. These shoes are likely of English origin and were imported, as the luxury shoe industry in the Colonies, though burgeoning in the 1750s was not fully established until the end of the century; it is, however, possible that they were made in an American workshop catering to a wealthy clientele.\"",

Though made in London, the shoes were most likely worn in the colonies, based on the donor record.

The design and workmanship of the embroidery indicates that it was done by an amateur, but it is charming in its design and use of color...According to family history, Captain Lemuel White purchased the silk in China, had it made into a stomacher in either England or the United States, and then gave the stomacher to his wife, Mary Wells White, in 1794. However, the stomacher is much earlier than the family history states, because women were no longer wearing stomachers on their gowns by the 1790s. (Bassett 3/28/2001)\"",
