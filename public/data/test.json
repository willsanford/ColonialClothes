Although this is unsubstantiated, she was certainly married to an Egbert Benjamin Egberts. They married in 1740, lived in Albany, owned property in New York City, and had four children. Her death date is unknown but at the time of Egberts' will in 1760 she was still living. A mourning locket in the New York Historical Society attributed to the Egberts family lists Egbert Egberts' death date as 1771 and Maria Lents' as 1784.",

The gown, shoes, and pocketbooks were apparently worn in New York by the same woman in the 18th century and likely in the 20th century by a descendant of the family."

        "provience": "Family history relates that this dress was worn by Elizabeth Park of Concord, Massachusetts at her marriage to Nicholas Baylies in 1738. She would have continued to wear it for many years, and like most 18th century dresses, it has been completely taken apart and remade at least once.",
        "notes": "In 1738, the bodice would not have met at center front, but would have had pleated edges (\"robings\") forming a V in front, and a V-shaped panel called a stomacher would have been pinned or sewn into the center of the bodice. In the 1770s when the stomacher style was replaced by bodices which met at center front, this dress was reconfigured by removing the robing pleats and adding strips of silk at center front. Great care was taken to make the design of the silk match at center front. The lining extends without a seam all the way to center front and thus dates to this later construction. At some point, an extra panel of the silk was basted into the open front of the dress to create the illusion of a matching petticoat. "
